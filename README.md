<h1>This is a repo to store all of my solutions for the Daily Byte</h1>

<p>Each solution is stored under the date in the script.js file</p>
<p>I may, at some point, create a different file in Python or C for some problems</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the daily byte, it's a daily newsletter with new problems every day. Check it out here: https://thedailybyte.dev</p>
